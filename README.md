# Advanced Clustering Techniques for Product Bundle Sales Data
This project involves an in-depth exploration and clustering analysis of sales transaction data using R programming. The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, consists of weekly sales transactions, and the objective is to uncover meaningful patterns and segments within the data to facilitate targeted marketing strategies and decision-making. Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) encompasses summary statistics, distribution analysis, and boxplot visualization to understand the dataset's structure and characteristics. Subsequently, various clustering techniques such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), Model-Based Clustering, and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) are applied to partition the data into distinct groups based on similarity. Evaluation metrics like silhouette analysis and gap statistics are employed to assess clustering quality, while visualization techniques such as dendrograms and silhouette plots aid in interpreting and communicating the clustering results effectively. The project's deliverables include comprehensive reports, visualizations, and actionable insights derived from the clustered data to optimize sales strategies and enhance business performance.


# Predicting Telecom Customer Churn with Python
This Python project aims to analyze and predict customer churn in a telecom dataset through a comprehensive workflow encompassing exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and machine learning model training. Initially, the dataset is loaded and examined to understand its structure, followed by addressing any missing values and converting categorical variables to the appropriate data types. EDA is conducted to gain insights into the distribution of churn and visualize relationships between features and churn status. After preprocessing, the data is split into training and testing sets, and several classification models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, are trained on the training data. The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as confusion matrices and classification reports. Additionally, ROC curves are plotted to assess the models' ability to discriminate between churn and non-churn instances. Finally, the project provides a comprehensive overview of customer churn prediction in the telecom industry using Python and machine learning techniques.
