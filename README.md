# Py-Data-Analysis
This project involves an in-depth exploration and clustering analysis of sales transaction data using R programming. The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, consists of weekly sales transactions, and the objective is to uncover meaningful patterns and segments within the data to facilitate targeted marketing strategies and decision-making. Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) encompasses summary statistics, distribution analysis, and boxplot visualization to understand the dataset's structure and characteristics. Subsequently, various clustering techniques such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), Model-Based Clustering, and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) are applied to partition the data into distinct groups based on similarity. Evaluation metrics like silhouette analysis and gap statistics are employed to assess clustering quality, while visualization techniques such as dendrograms and silhouette plots aid in interpreting and communicating the clustering results effectively. The project's deliverables include comprehensive reports, visualizations, and actionable insights derived from the clustered data to optimize sales strategies and enhance business performance.
